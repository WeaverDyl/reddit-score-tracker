# Reddit Score Tracker

This repo contains a Python script to collect reddit post score data, writing it to a CSV file. The CSV file will contain the timestamp of when the data was collected as well as the score that the post had at the time.

This data can then be used with a simple R program that's included. It uses ggplot to produce a scatter plot of the posts score over time.
